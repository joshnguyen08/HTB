Let’s try some of the exploits
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7269 

     Name: Microsoft IIS WebDav ScStoragePathFromUrl Overflow
     Module: exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl

Description:
  Buffer overflow in the ScStoragePathFromUrl function
  in the WebDAV service in Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0
  in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 R2 allows remote attackers to
  execute arbitrary code via a long header beginning with
  "If: <http://" in a PROPFIND request, as exploited in the
  wild in July or August 2016.

I’m going to use metasploit local_exploit_suggester in post/multi/recon on the meterpreter session

Let’s go down the list and see what we can do.

exploit/windows/local/ms15_051_client_copy_image was able to get us in after migrating our PID to one with higher permissions.
