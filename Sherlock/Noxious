Noxious

About Noxious
In this sherlock, players will go through network traffic and uncover credential-stealing technique by abusing the LLMNR protocol feature in Windows.
Players will learn how a victim made a typo navigating to a network share and how the attacker was using the Responder tool to steal hashes and pose as a legitimate device in the internal network. 
Players will also learn to crack NTLMV2 hashes by gathering information from SMB traffic.



Sherlock Scenario
The IDS device alerted us to a possible rogue device in the internal Active Directory network. 
The Intrusion Detection System also indicated signs of LLMNR traffic, which is unusual. It is suspected that an LLMNR poisoning attack occurred. 
The LLMNR traffic was directed towards Forela-WKstn002, which has the IP address 172.17.79.136. 
A limited packet capture from the surrounding time is provided to you, our Network Forensics expert. 
Since this occurred in the Active Directory VLAN, it is suggested that we perform network threat hunting with the Active Directory attack vector in mind, specifically focusing on LLMNR poisoning.
