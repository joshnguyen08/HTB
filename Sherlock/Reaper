Summary of event
An attacker intercepted the NTLM hash of Arthur Kyle during his legitimate access to a file share on the Domain Controller. The attacker then used that stolen hash to gain unauthorized access to FORELA-WKSTN002. The security alert was triggered because the source IP of the malicious logon (172.17.79.135) did not match the expected workstation (FORELA-WKSTN002). This was most likely a man-in-the-middle attack orchestrated after gaining initial network access into the internal system.
